The code uses a postgress database but it should be easily changed to another db.

You will need to create a database table called 'upload'.

The table requires following columns:
	'rand', a random key used for URL
	'links', csv data file as a string
	'fileName', shown inpage title
	'layout', used for saved layout
	'fasta', protein sequence data as fasta file format string

You will need to add a connection string for your database into these files: 
	fup.php, handles file upload then redirects to unique URL
	uploaded.php, displays data, needs random key as http get parameter
	saveLayout.php, writes saved layouts into db	

careful not to check your db password into github :) 

example.html contains an example html form for file upload.
